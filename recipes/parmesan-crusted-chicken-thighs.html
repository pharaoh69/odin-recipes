    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Juicy chicken thighs are topped with a Parmesan-panko mixture, which ensures a crispy, crunchy crust. I normally prefer to use freshly grated Parmesan cheese in my dishes, however I find the shaker-style grated Parmesan works best in this recipe.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>nonstick cooking spray</li>
        <li>1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>1/4 cup panko bread crumbs</li>
        <li>3/4 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>4 (6 ounce bone-in, skin on chicken thighs</li>
        <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1/4 cup mayonnaise</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with foil and spray with cooking spray.</li>
        <li>Combine Parmesan cheese, panko, and garlic powder in a shallow bowl and set aside.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle chicken on both sides with salt and pepper. Brush skin liberally with mayonnaise. Press each thigh, skin-side down, into crumb mixture. Place thighs on baking sheet, skin-side up, and mist lightly with cooking spray.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until chicken is no longer pink in the center and juices run clear, 35 to 40 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
    </ol>
